### Built with

- Flexbox
- [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)

### What I learned

In completing this challenge, I was reminded that flexbox elements with a flex-direction: column declaration still stretch horizontally. In order to constrain the width of the QR code container, I used a max-width declaration.

### Continued development

In future projects, I need to commit more frequently.
